# CS370FinalProject
1. Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

For this project, I recieved a starter code and a sample environment where a pirate agent was placed. The objective of the project was to create a deep Q-learning algorithm and to train the pirate agent to reach the designated treasure with 100% efficency. The Q-training algorithm created required that the pirate gets the treasure and that the deep Q-learning algorithm could solve a pathfinding problem without error using industry-standard best practices.

2. Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
a. What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer scientists design and implement technology used to solve various problems. They often create software, applications, and systems to serve a wide variety of functions while keeping various types of users in mind. The technology that is created by computer scientists often enables its users to more efficent at the task they are attempting which can greatly impact the proficiency of an individual or business.  

b. How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

As a computer scientist, I approach problems by first identifying what is known and unknown. Once I have determined the information and tools that will required to complete a problem, I prepare a roadmap that highlights the necessary components to ensure the problem is addressed fully. After I have begun working on a problem, I review lines of code to ensure that they meet the requirements necessary to correct the problem. Lastly, I ensure that ethical dilemas are not created and that the finish problem is free of bias. 

c. What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

My ethical responsibilties to the end user is  to recognize that AI are created by individuals who may contain their own biases that can alter the intention of the system. Unattended consequences may arise if a product provides incorrect information or fails to interact and provide similar experiences to all types of users. Additionally, I must ensure that user data and information is protected and that safeguards are in place to prevent against theft from potential hackers.
